    <!-- Amount of partitions datasets are divided to. 
         Lower bounds for partitions quantity are : 
            - total amount of CPU cores in all nodes of Spark cluster (dividing into fewer partitions would keep some cores/nodes idle)
            - size of each partition must be less than 2Gb (limitation of Spark).
         For pepetide generation, we used one partition for 100M peptides (or 5120 partitons for the universe of 512G 9-meer peptides)
         1/10 of this number is used for cluster centers in AssignBindersToClusters-->
